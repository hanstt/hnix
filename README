Hans' Linux things
==================

A small collection of small scripts and programs that I have written to make
life really comfortable. As long as one uses a reasonable distro like
Slackware, otherwise eternal misery and pain shall forever... You get the
idea.


hacpi
-----

ACPI scripts for handling ACPI thingamajigs, events and polling, for when
events don't work, mainly in order to save battery time.


hpower
------

A little program to fetch and print the AC and battery status to stdout.


hpwd
----

Fetches the present working directory and prints it with up to at most 2
directories. Handles ~, / etc in a reasonable manner. Useful for the bash
prompt, e.g.:
 PS1="\u@\h:\$(~/opt/bin/hpwd)\$"


hwm
---

My little xcb-based window manager. Has its own README, because although I do
what I can to keep it simple and small, it is still large. Figures.
