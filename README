Hans' *nix things
=================
A small collection of small scripts and programs that I have written to make
life really comfortable. As long as one uses a reasonable Linux distro like
Slackware or OpenBSD, otherwise eternal misery and pain shall forever... You
get the idea.


hacpi
-----
ACPI scripts for handling Linux ACPI thingamajigs, events and polling, for
when events don't work, mainly in order to save battery time.


hlinuxbat
---------
A little program to fetch and print the AC and battery status to stdout under
Linux.


hobsdbat
--------
I'll let you figure this one out yourself.


hpwd
----
Fetches the present working directory and prints it with up to at most 2
parent directories. Handles ~, / etc in a reasonable manner, I think. Useful
for the bash prompt, e.g.:
 PS1="\u@\h:\$(~/opt/bin/hpwd)\$"


hwm
---
My little xcb-based window manager, 100% rewritten variant of dwm. Has its own
README, because although I do what I can to keep it simple and small, it is
still large. Figures.
