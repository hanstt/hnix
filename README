Hans' *nix things
=================
A small collection of small scripts and programs that I have written to make
my life comfortable. As long as one uses a reasonable Linux distro like
Slackware or OpenBSD.


hacpi
-----
ACPI scripts for handling Linux ACPI thingamajigs, events and polling, for
when events don't work, mainly in order to save battery time. Other than what
was stated in the intro.


hapm
----
APM scripts for handling OpenBSD APM related things.


hlinuxbat
---------
A little program to fetch and print the AC and battery status to stdout under
Linux.


hobsdbat
--------
I'll let you figure this one out yourself.


hobsdpkg
--------
Various OpenBSD package tools which I like to use. Currently only pkg_wipe,
which iteratively asks for what leaf packages can be removed.


hpwd
----
Fetches the present working directory and prints it with up to at most 2
parent directories. Handles ~, / etc in a reasonable manner, I think. Useful
for the bash prompt, e.g.:
 PS1="\u@\h:\$(~/opt/bin/hpwd)\$"


hwm
---
My little xcb-based window manager, based on dwm but 100% rewritten. Has its
own README, because although I do what I can to keep it simple and small, it
is still large.


WIP

h202020
-------
Little notifier for the 20-20-20 rule. A small top-level window pops up every
20 minutes, reminding you to look 20 m (originally 20 ft, but I don't know
what that unit means) for 20 s. The timer resets when the window is manually
closed.
