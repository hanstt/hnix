hwm - hans's window manager
===========================

hwm is a _very_ light-weight WM, based initially on dwm but then completely
rewritten with XCB. It's a WM for me.


Features
--------
Having very few features, stuff I don't need are not in.
Almost as fast as lightning.
Fewer than 2k LOC without being obfuscated.
Stacking with "smart" placement and furnishing.
Make windows jump around with the keyboard.
Persistent window data at restarts.
Very few mouse-dependent actions.


Requirements
------------
You will need XCB and a generally healthy Linux system.


Installation
------------
Edit the very simple Makefile to customize the build.

At long last, enter the following command to build and install hwm:

    make install

Wait, why isn't it this easy with all programs?


Running hwm
-----------
Put this in your .xinitrc/.xsession/wherever hip Linux distros want it:

	while true; do
		<hwm install>/hwm &> /tmp/hwm.log
		if [ 2 -eq $? ]; then
			break
		fi
	done

Exit codes:

    0 - Just quit
    1 - Something bad happened
    2 - Restart

In order to display info in the bar instead of seeing the beautiful <hwm> art,
you can do something like this:

	while true; do
		./<scripts directory>/xsetroot.sh
	done &
	root_loop_pid=$!
	<Do the above hwm loop here>
	kill $root_loop_pid

where the xsetroot.sh script can contain e.g.:

	#!/bin/sh
	xsetroot -name "`date`"
	sleep 5

This way you can edit the status text while hwm is running.

If the status string starts with an exclamation mark, hwm will flash the
status box, useful e.g. for low battery level warning (pst, see hpower).


Configuration
-------------
hwm is configured by editing the source code, the most interesting configs
have been isolated near the top. Rebuild, install and restart hwm and the new
configs will be active.


I implemented a cool new feature!
---------------------------------
Great! I don't want to sound like a jerk, but I don't want it :p
