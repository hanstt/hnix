hwm - hans's window manager
===========================

hwm is a _very_ light-weight WM, based initially on dwm but then completely
rewritten with XCB. It's a WM for me.


Features
--------
*) Having very few features, stuff I don't need are not in.
*) Snappy, no animations.
*) Fewer than 2k LOC without being obfuscated (debatable).
*) Stacking with "smart" placement and furnishing.
*) Make windows jump around with the keyboard.
*) Persistent window metadata at restarts.
*) Very few mouse-only actions.


Prerequisites
-------------
You will need XCB and a generally healthy *nix system.


Installation
------------
Edit the very simple Makefile to customize the build.

At long last, enter the following command to build and install hwm:

    make install


Running hwm
-----------
Put this in .xinitrc/.xsession/wherever hip Linux distros want this stuff:

	while true
	do
		<hwm install>/hwm
		[ 2 -eq $? ] || break
	done

Exit codes:
    0 - Graceful quit
    1 - Something bad happened
    2 - Restart

In order to display info in the bar instead of seeing the <hwm> art, you can
do something like this:

	while true
	do
		<some-path>/xsetroot.bash
	done &
	root_loop_pid=$!

	# Do the above hwm loop here

	kill $root_loop_pid

where the xsetroot.bash script contains e.g.:

	#!/bin/bash
	xsetroot -name "$(date)"
	sleep 5

This way you can edit the status text while hwm is running.

If the status string starts with an exclamation mark, hwm will flash the
status box, useful e.g. for low battery level warning (pst, see h*bat).


Configuration
-------------
hwm is configured by editing the source code, the most interesting configs
are sheltered in config.h, which is renewed from config.def.h.
'c_font_face' should be set to an entry listed by 'xlsfonts'.
Rebuild, install, and restart hwm, and the new configs will be active.


I implemented a cool new feature!
---------------------------------
Great! I don't want to sound like a jerk, but I don't want it :p Git it!
