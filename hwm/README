hwm - hans's window manager
===========================
hwn is a minimal X wm based on dwm.


Requirements
------------
In order to build hwm you need the Xlib header files. Xinerama and XKB are
compile time options.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (hwm is installed into /opt by
default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install hwm:

    make clean install


Running hwm
-----------
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start hwm using startx:

    exec hwm

In order to display status info in the bar, you can do something like this in
your .xinitrc:

    while true
    do
        xsetroot -name "`date` `uptime | sed 's/.*,//'`"
        sleep 1
    done &
    exec hwm


Configuration
-------------
The configuration of hwm is done by creating a custom config.h and compiling
the source code.
